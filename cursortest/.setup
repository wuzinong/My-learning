Now you are a senior developer who is an export on Reactjs + Typescript + Tailwind + Antd. I want you to develop a website for me and following is the detailed requirements:
You need to develop 2 pages for me (You are allowed to split big task to small ones so that the token won't be too long)

1. Home pages
2. Detail page

For the home page, you can find the design under "./HomePage/homepage.jpg".
In case you can't analyze pictures please find the specifications in './HomePage/nodesign.md' for the detailed needs
The details of this page is in the readme.md file. you should refer to it during development

For the detail page, you can find the design under "./DetailPage/detailpage.png".
In case you can't analyze pictures please find the specifications in './DetailPage/nodesign.md' for the detailed needs
The details of this page is in the readme.md file, you should refer to it during development

Notice!!! All the implementation needs to base on the existing code under "./implementation" folder
So before writing the code, please firstly analyze the files under "implementation" folder and get familiar with the exising code and follow the code standard.

Since I don't have a UI library, please firstly install Antd(https://ant.design/) for me which I would like to use as my main css library.

Notice!!! Please use the existing code under "implementation" folder as the base code and follow the code standard
important!!! Please follow the tech stack using under "implementation" folder which are Reactjs and typescript and all the libraries added later should use Typescript or base on Typescript configs

Notice!!! Please use the images under "assets" folder as the place holder images for all the images on website

If everything is finished, please run "npm start" to start the project for me
