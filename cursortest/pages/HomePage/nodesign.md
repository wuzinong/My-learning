The home page contains 3 parts: (You can refer to https://storetest.veracity.com/ to see the website I want to create)
1. Header
2. Content
3. Footer

Please implement the website for me on PC side and make it compatitable on Mobile side
Following is the detailed style of each parts:
1. Header
   It contains 2 parts, left part is a Logo, right part contains Several links which will direct user to Marketplace,My services, My data and support (You can use place holder urls but keep the link name the same as I mentioned). Then add a Bell icon and a Avata with circle style

2. Content
   At the top of the content there will be a search bar which user can directly search through it (Add some effect when user focusing into the input).
   In the middle, for the left part there are filter options like Industry, Category,Product type and Provider. On the right part all the products are listed (I need a layout with 3 columns) and add a loadmore button at the bottom so that it would load more when user click on it

3. Footer
   It contains a list of links which is 4 columns under different categories like Platform, Industory, Partnership, Developer, Support, Legal
